Lesson 1:

What is a Data Structure?
-  A Data Structure is a collection of values.
- The values can have relationships among them and functions applied to them.
- Each Data Structure is good and specilized for its own thing.
- The purpose is to organize data so we can go back and retrieve that data easly.
- We can add to a data structure and take from a data structure.
- Based on different scenarios, data needs to be stored in a specific format.


Two Parts of Data Structures:
1. How to build one.
2. How to use it.


Lesson 2:

How Computers Store Data:
- Each Data type has a number of bits associated with it and that needs to get stored in the system.
- The system then allocates that storage, the the CPU (Computer) reads from that storage.
- So, Data Structures is an arraingment of data, you can define the way you enteract with it, and how it is arrainged in RAM (Random Access Memory).
- Some Data in RAM is organized next to each other, some are apart.
- Our goal is to minimize the operation that we need to do for the CPU to get the information, for the CPU to write information.

Lesson 3: 

Data Structures in Different Languages:

- Each Language has its own Data Types.
- In JS we have integrs, strings, booleans etc.
- Each Language has Data Structures to organize these data types.
- In JS we have Arrays and Objects.

Lesson 4: 

Operations on Data Structures:

Operations that could be performed on a Data Structure:

- Insertion: Add a new data item in a given collection of items.
- Deletion: Remove data.
- Traversal: Access each Data item exactly once so that it could be proccessed.
- Searching: Access the location of a data item if it exsits in a data collection.
- Sorting: organizing data.
- Access (Most important): How to access data in our Compute.
