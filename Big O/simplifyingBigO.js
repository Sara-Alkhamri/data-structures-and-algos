//Big O Rule Book

//Rule 1: Worst Case.

//We always care about what is the worst case scenario becuase we can't assume thongs will go well i.e when running a for loop, we can't assume
//the item we are looking for will be the first in the array.

//So if we can't be certain what the input will be, we will assume the big O is O(n) or linear time.

//Rule 2: Remove Constants.

//Big-O notation doesn't care about constants because big-O notation only describes the long-term growth rate of functions, rather than their absolute magnitudes. Multiplying a function by a constant only influences its growth rate by a constant amount, so linear functions still grow linearly, 
//logarithmic functions still grow logarithmically, exponential functions still grow exponentially, etc. 
//Since these categories aren't affected by constants, it doesn't matter that we drop the constants.

//Rule 3: Different terms for inputs.

//Rule 4: Drp non dominants
